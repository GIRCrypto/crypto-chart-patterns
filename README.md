### Intro

According to BabyPips there are [3 main groups](https://www.babypips.com/learn/forex/how-to-trade-chart-patterns) of trading patterns:

1. Reversal
   * Double Top
   * Double Bottom
   * Head and Shoulders
   * Inverse Head and Shoulders
   * Rising Wedge
   * Falling Wedge
2. Continuation
   * wedges
   * rectangles
   * pennants
* Note that wedges can be considered either reversal or continuation patterns depending on the trend on which they form.
3. Bi-lateral
   * Triangles

## Broadening Formations [**^**](#Contents)

Broadening formations are generally considered bearish, and involve increased volitility with no clear direction.

Good for those who work on a low timeframe.

>A broadening formation is an example of a consolidation pattern and a highly useful tool in the prediction of the likelihood of a reversal in the direction of a current trend. When found in an uptrend it indicates not a continuation of that trend, but a near-term reversal of the price action.

Bulkowski seems to be the only person who has tested different broadening patterns, mostly they are considered as a class and not worth spending too much time on the variants unless noted otherwise.

* [Bulkowski - Broadening Tops](http://thepatternsite.com/bt.html)

>Broadening tops, not surprisingly, act a lot like broadening bottoms. What separates a top from a bottom is the price trend leading to the chart pattern.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/wJhx8U7.png"/>


>There should be at least two minor highs and two minor lows before die chart pattern becomes a broadening top. A minor high is another name for a distinct price peak. A minor low refers to the valley pattern as prices descend to a low then turn back up. Again, the minor low should be a distinct trough that is easily recognizable. Figure 4.1 shows diree minor highs touching die top trendline and four minor lows either nearing or touching die bottom trendline. The minor highs and minor lows need not alternate as prices crisscross die formation.


### Right-Angled and Ascending [**^**](#Contents)

* [Bulkowski - Broadening formations: Right-Angled and Ascending](http://thepatternsite.com/rabfa.html)

>The right-angled and ascending broadening chart pattern is not one you might choose to trade. -[source](https://education.howthemarketworks.com/advanced/charts-and-patterns/broadening-formations-right-angled-and-ascending/)

>Right-angled ascending broadening formations: What does the name mean? Right angle implies that it is a member of the triangle family. A horizontal base with an up-sloping hypotenuse forms a right triangle. The third side drops down from the hypotenuse to the base and intersects it at a 90 degree angle, forming the so-called right angle. Ascending means that the hypotenuse ascends over time as contrasted with descending broadening formations. Broadening formation means that prices make higher highs. Ascending and descending triangles, in contrast, have narrowing price movements.

### Right-Angled and Descending [**^**](#Contents)

* [Bulkowski - Broadening formations: Right-Angled and Descending](http://thepatternsite.com/rabfd.html)

The characteristic flat top and down-sloping bottom are apparent in the figure. These are the two key ingredients. Prices at the top of the formation reach the same price level before declining. Over time, a horizontal trendline can be drawn connecting them. 

Along the bottom of the formation, the minor lows touch a down-sloping trendline before prices rebound. Eventually, prices break out of the formation by either closing above the top trendline or below the bottom one.


## Bump-and-Run Reversal Bottoms [**^**](#Contents)

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/C3adH9M.png"/>

* https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/bump/
* [Bulkowski - Bump and Run Reversal Bottoms](http://thepatternsite.com/barrb.html)
  >The bump-and-run reversal bottom is a chart pattern that is a surprisingly good performer in both bull and bear markets. It has a low break even failure rate and high average rise after the breakout. Discovered by Thomas Bulkowski in 1999.

If you wait for a breakout, the failure rate drops from 19% to 9%. I consider anything less than 20% to indicate a reliable formation. The average gain is 37%. This is a bit shy of the usual 40% for bullish formations, but the most likely rise, at 20%, is quite good.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/t6Ft0C9.png"/>

Many would recognize this formation as a cup-with-handle, and indeed it is. But it is also a BARR bottom, as a cup does not depend on a down-sloping trendline and a larger handle on the left such as that shown in Figure 7.1. Whatever you call the formation, the result is still the same: Prices move
higher.

<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/ITC/d5Pr576Q-ITC-Bulkowski-s-Bump-and-Run-Reversal-Bottoms-LONG/"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/hJAhGQL.png"></a>


## Bump-and-Run Reversal Tops [**^**](#Contents)

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/2JpGC1p.png"/>

* https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/bump/
* [Bulkowski - Bump and Run Reversal Top](http://thepatternsite.com/barrt.html)

The overall formation reminds me of a mountain range. The foothills at the start of the formation are low and subdued, not venturing too far above the up-sloping plain. Volume at the start of the formation is high but quickly recedes. The mountains themselves rise up well above the foothills on high volume. 

Investor enthusiasm continues high as prices round over at the top, then diminishes on the far side. When the mountains end, prices decline sharply and continue moving down. That is a BARR. Prices bump-up, round over, and run back down again. The formation is the visual representation of momentum. The base of the formation follows a trendline that always slopes upward. It signals investors' eagerness to acquire the stock. As each day goes by, investors bid higher to reluctant sellers and the price rises

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/jEwAZ1E.png"/>


Other momentum players eventually notice the rise in the stock price. Many jump on the bandwagon the day after a surprisingly good earnings announcement. That is when the bump begins. Volume spikes upward along with the stock price. Quickly rising prices entice others to join the fray and that, in turn, sends the stock even higher. As momentum increases, prices jump up to form a new, higher-sloping trendline. Then things start going wrong.


## Cup with Handle [**^**](#Contents)

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/piGF9G6.png"/>\

* [Bulkowski - Cup with Handle](http://thepatternsite.com/cup.html)
* [Babypips - Cup and Handle](https://www.babypips.com/forexpedia/cup-with-handle)

As I was selecting cup-with-handle formations, it became apparent that locating cups during an uptrend is important. So, I adopted O'Neil's criteria of a minimum 30% rise leading up to the cup.

All the cups are U-shaped (V-shaped ones being removed). Also removed from the study were cups without handles. To me, a cup without a handle is a rounding bottom

## Dead-Cat Bounce [**^**](#Contents)

It is not so much a chart formation as it is a warning to exit the stock quickly after a dramatic decline. The event decline, which is the decline that spawns the dead-cat bounce, averages 25%. After the event decline, prices bounce up, round over, and continue down another 15%, on average (measured from the event low to the ultimate low). 

The larger the event decline, the larger the bounce. 

## Diamond Tops and Bottoms [**^**](#Contents)

* [Diamond Top Formation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/diamondtop.asp)
* [Babypips - Diamond](https://www.babypips.com/forexpedia/diamond)

In appearance, the only difference between the two diamond patterns is the price trend leading to the formation. For diamond tops, the prior price trend is upward, whereas diamond bottoms have price trends that lead down to the formation.


<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/ETHBTC/INJrp9Cq-ETH-BTC-Diamond-Chart-Formation/"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ypAwM5z.png"/></a>
>The Diamond pattern is a rare, but reliable chart pattern. Diamond chart reversals rarely happen at market bottoms, it most often occurs at major tops and with high-volume. Bulkowski's (2005) research states that the diamond bottom breaks upward 69% of the time. Bulkowski emphasizes that a diamond bottom with a breakout move downward is ranked as being one the best performing patterns. You should always use a stop loss order when trading the diamond pattern. The proper location of your stop should be above the last top inside the diamond for bearish setups and below the last low of inside the diamond for bullish setups. - ([source](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/ETHBTC/INJrp9Cq-ETH-BTC-Diamond-Chart-Formation/))

## Double Bottoms [**^**](#Contents)

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/dFtYbCI.png"/>

* [Babypips - Learn - Double Top and Double Bottom](https://www.babypips.com/learn/forex/double-top-and-double-bottom)
* [Investopedia - University - Double Tops and Double Bottoms](https://www.investopedia.com/university/charts/charts4.asp)

* [Bulkowski's Double Bottom Types](http://thepatternsite.com/DoubleBottomTypes.html)
* [Bulkowski's Double Bottom Setup](http://thepatternsite.com/dbsetup.html)


Perhaps the biggest surprise with double bottoms is the high failure rate at 64%. Only a third of the formations classify as true double bottoms. They are the ones that have prices rising above the confirmation point, which is the highest high between the two lows. The failure rate tumbles to just 3 % if one waits for confirmation. Only those formations with confirmed breakouts are evaluated in this study.

<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/NZDCAD/NgLOZjGz-NZDCAD-Possible-Double-Bottom-and-a-H-S-Failure/"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/azIqHVp.png"/></a>

A double bottom is not a true double bottom until prices rise above the confirmation point. In tabulating the statistics, / only count those double bottoms in which prices rise above the confirmation point. Why? Because of the high failure rate: 64%. There were 980 formations that looked like double bottoms, but their price trends eventually moved below the second bottom. 

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/53OpzHM.png"/>

An additional 525 formations performed as expected by rising to the confirmation point and continuing higher. If you buy a stock just after it touches the second bottom, your chances of having a successful trade are one in three. In other words, wait for prices to rise above the confirmation point.

## Double Tops [**^**](#Contents)

* [Tradingview - Ideas - Double Tops](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/doubletop/)

If wait for the breakout, then you will be correct in dumping your shares 83% of the time. However, almost half the formations decline less than 15%, and nearly two out of three formations fall shy of their predicted price targets.


>The double top is one of the most popular patterns in trading. It's a reliable reversal pattern that can be used to enter a bearish position after a bullish trend. It consists of 2 tops at nearly the same level with a valley in between, which creates the neckline. The second top does not break the level of the first top, so the price retested this level and tried to make a higher high, but failed. Price breaking the neckline and closing below it would complete the pattern. 

>Conservative traders look for additional confirmation and aggressive traders may enter a bearish position from the second top. The target can be estimated by measuring the height of the pattern and projecting this downwards from the neckline. Common stop levels are just above the neckline, halfway between the neckline and the tops or above the tops.

<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/EURUSD/XEPEQbbm-3-TRADING-STRATEGY-S-IN-ONE-CHART-EXPLAINED/"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/45lsZvz.png"/></a>

For double tops, only 39% of the formations decline far enough to fulfill the prediction. Reliable values are above 80%. The poor showing of this formation further emphasizes that many double top patterns do not decline far and this formation may not be worth trading at all.

The question then becomes, is it worth taking profits on a confirmed double top? If prices continue down an additional 15 % and then turn around, why not just wait for prices to recover? Those are good questions. If you sell when the double top is confirmed, you may be selling near the ultimate low.

## Flags and Pennants [**^**](#Contents)

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/q0PnCFP.png"/>

Flags and pennants look alike and in many ways their performance is similar, too. The formations are usually very short in duration, from a few days to 3 weeks, and mark the halfway point in a quick price move. 


<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/EURINR/WZdNVSyC-Educational-07-Flag-and-Pennant-Patterns/"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/muwtsBo.png"></a>

These formations can be profitable short-term investments, but you must be nimble and attentive to take full advantage of them. 

Pennants, with a failure rate of 34% in downtrends, are above the 20% rate I consider acceptable. Flags at 12% to 13 % and pennants in a uptrend (19%) perform better.

### Flags

* [Bulkowski - Flags](http://thepatternsite.com/flags.html)

The percentage of formations that meet or exceed their predicted price targets is disappointing for both flags and pennants. I view values above 80% to be reliable, but the results show values that range from 52% to 63%, suggesting that you should trade these formations with caution as your profits may not be as large as you expect.

* [High and Tight Flag Pattern](https://www.tothetick.com/archives/1835)

Having recently completed the chapter on flags and pennants, I was surprised to discover an abundance of high, right flags. 

>if you wait for an upside breakout, the rate drops to 17%. Reliable formations have failure rates below 20%, so high, tight flags score well providing you wait for the breakout.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/X36eWBB.png"/>

First and most importantly there must be a short, quick rise. Flags with a receding volume trend handily outperform those without. However, I would not ignore a high, tight flag simply because volume is rising. Rather, I would recognize that its  performance may be subpar.


## Gaps [**^**](#Contents)

* [Bulkowski - Gauging Gaps](http://thepatternsite.com/GaugingGaps.html)

A gap appears in an uptrend price series when yesterday's daily high is below today's low price. A downtrend gap is similar, being created when yesterday's low is above today's high. In both cases, some type of exuberance is driving the
stock to create a gap. 

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/zW5p40p.png"/>

It sometimes is nothing more than the stock being worth less simply because of a dividend distribution. At other times, the repercussions are more severe. An earnings surprise, either positive or negative, often causes a gap and the stock to rise by 10% or 15% or to decline by 30% or more, depending on the severity of the news

* [Investopedia - Ideas - Hanging Man](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/hangingman/)
* [Investopdedia - Scripts - Hanging Man](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/hangingman/)

Hanging man formations with upside breakouts show gains averaging 40%, which is quite good, but the most likely gain is 10%—comparatively poor. For downside breakouts, the average loss is 16% with a likely loss between 5% and 10%. If you decide to trade this formation, do not expect a large price move.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/l29D51i.png">

After careful consideration, I cannot recommend trading this formation. The primary belief behind this chart pattern is that prices will reverse the uptrend. They do not. Just a third of the formations reverse, whereas the others see prices continue higher.

>With 93% of the formations breaking out downward and continuing to move down, there is no need to wait for a breakout before trading.

>When a formation appears with more than the standard two shoulders and one head it is called a complex head-and-shoulders pattern. Complex head-and-shoulders patterns for both tops and bottoms have their own chapters but many appear in this chapter's statistics. They are, after all, head-and-shoulder tops too.

### HS Tops-Complex [**^**](#Contents)

* [Bulkowski - Head and Shoulders Top-Complex](http://thepatternsite.com/chst.html)

A head-and-shoulders formation with multiple heads,
shoulders, or both

<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/s6nLX8fl-BTC-1-hr-complex-head-and-shoulders-top-with-price-target-8900/"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/1hapzsv.png"/></a>

>Except for appearance, there is not much difference between a normal headand-shoulders top and a complex one. Add a dual head or a few extra shoulders to a regular formation and you have a complex head-and-shoulders top. The left shoulders often have higher volume than the corresponding right ones.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/Rh2tyXx.png"/>

>If you ignore the labels for a moment, the inner price action looks like a rounding top. This smooth price rollover is common for complex head-andshoulder formations. Of course, the flat head shape for a multiple shoulder pattern (Figure 21.2) is also typical.

>Investors typically enter into a long position when the price rises above the resistance of the neckline. The first and third trough are considered shoulders, and the second peak forms the head. A move above the resistance, also known as the neckline, is used as a signal of a sharp move higher.

## Inside Days [**^**](#Contents)

A daily price range narrower than the prior day

* [TradingView - Scripts - Inside Day](https://www.tradingview.com/script/KvyWCIYN-Inside-Day/)
* [TradingView - Ideas - Inside Bar](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/insidebar/)

The theory behind the formation says an investor can expect a large price move the day after an inside day;

<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/USDJPY/sKSELCBl-USDJPY-inside-bar-trade/"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/1BitDsp.png"></a>

>"when the close is within 25% of the prior day's low, a downside breakout occurs 70% of the time. Thus, if you have an inside day that closes near the prior days low, expect a downside breakout"

* [Bulkowski - Outside Days](http://thepatternsite.com/OutsideDays.html)
>Outside days often serve as part of a continuation pattern in the direction of the latest candlestick. For example, a bullish outside day occurring during an uptrend is a signal that the uptrend is expected to continue. However, outside days can also act as reversal patterns depending on the context. An outside reversal will include an outside day pattern in the opposite direction of the security’s price trend.

## Measured Move Down [**^**](#Contents)

* [Bulkowski - Measured Move Down](http://thepatternsite.com/mmd.html)
* [Wiley - Measured Move Down](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781119274933.ch11)
  >The measured move down is a unique chart pattern best used as a tool to help predict where price is going. The second leg of the measured move approaches the length and duration of the first leg. Once the measured move down completes, price often retraces to the corrective phase, too. That is invaluable information for swing traders.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/y2jzXbN.png"/>

>Unfortunately, with a failure rate of 22%, it is also more risky.  That is not to say that this one is unreliable, especially since it has a 36% average decline, which is well above the usual 20% decline for bearish reversals. For this formation even the most likely decline is high but wide at 25% to 40%.

Yes, its just like measured move down, but going up.

>The measured move up sports a 23 % failure rate, slightly higher than the 20% maximum I consider reliable formations to possess. However, the average gain is an astounding 68%, which is misleading.

  >Most technicians agree, the rectangle can serve as either a reversal or continuation formation. As a reversal pattern, it ends a trend either up or down. As a continuation pattern, it signifies a pause in the prevailing trend, with the expectation that the prior trend will eventually resume. In either case, the rectangle shows a tug of war between buyers and sellers.

>If you consider upside breakouts only (a breakout being when prices move above the left saucer lip), then the failure rate drops to just 5%.


## Rounding Top [**^**](#Contents)

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/8h5IOLL.png"/>\
As prices move up, they curve around then breakout upward.

Contrary to Bulkowski, most traders seem to look at these as more likely to break down. Because of the conflicting ideas, I would ignore this pattern and move to some other indicator.

## Scallops [**^**](#Contents)

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/JIv7ite.png"/>

There are 4 different types of scallops: ascending, ascending inverted, descending, descending inverted. The basic idea is its a curved angle, often in a series of proportionally smaller curves.

* [TradingView - Ideas - Scallop](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/scallop/)

>The percentage rise for ascending scallops is 33%, respectable but mediocre when compared to other bullish formations. For descending scallops, the declines average 24%; that is quite good (we usually see a 20% decline for bearish patterns). The measure rule is weak in both species and especially so with the descending variety—only 52% of the chart patterns reach their price targets.

### Ascending Scallops [**^**](#Contents)

Prices peak, retrace, and curve around then form a higher peak. The price pattern looks like the letter J.

### Triple Bottoms [**^**](#Contents)

Three distinct minor lows at about the same price level

* [TradingView - Ideas - Triple Bottom](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/triple-bottom/)

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/u3faOkU.png"/>

One of the surprising things about triple bottoms is their low failure rate: 4%. For some reason, I expected it to be higher. If one plays by the rules and waits for an upside breakout, then few triple bottoms fail to continue moving up, many times substantially. The average rise is 38% with a likely gain of 20%, about what you would expect from bullish formations.


<img src="http://i.imgur.com/dzUr23v.png">

Obviously the above tripple bottom didn't pan out for Bitcoin.

Just for kicks, I measured the average gain for those formations with a third bottom above the low posted by the second one. The gain is 48%, whereas those with a third bottom below the second one score gains averaging just 31%.

The differences are statistically significant but it may surprise you to learn the average price difference between the two bottoms is only 35 cents.

## Triple Tops [**^**](#Contents)

* [TradingView - Ideas - Triple Top](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/triple-top/)

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/WDRtKsi.png">

The failure rate at 15% for triple tops approaches the 20% maximum*! consider permissible for reliable formations. Still, there are a number of formations that perform worse, so there is no reason for concern. 

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/6Oyx1Dp.png">

One surprising finding about triple tops is when the price of the highest high in the third top is above the second top. Formations with this configuration have losses of 22% versus 17%. The differences are statistically significant
meaning that die results likely are not due to chance.

There are no outstanding surprises among the statistics shown in the Results Snapshot. The failure rate for falling wedges is low at 10%, with an average rise of 43% and a likely rise of between 20% and 30%.

As formations go, the rising wedge is one of the poorer performing chart patterns. It sports a failure rate of 24%, which falls to 6% if you wait for a downside breakout. The average decline is 19%, just a bit below the usual
20% decline for other bearish chart patterns.

<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/rUE7pMk0-Rising-Wedge-Pattern-TUTORIAL/"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/l1KQAoZ.png"></a>

One interesting finding concerns the volume trend. Successful formations with a receding volume trend outperform those with a rising volume trend; the losses are 21% and 15%, respectively. This means if you restrict your selections to those showing receding volume throughout the formation, you should do better. On the flip side, you will also be passing up many formations in which you could trade profitably.

>descending broadening wedges act as a consolidation of the prevailing trend. The volume pattern is also different from falling wedges. In the descending broadening wedge formation, the volume tends to increase over time but with falling wedges, it decreases.


Being a consolidation in a bull market, the average rise is a very high 46%. The most likely rise is 20% and an astounding 40% of the formations have gains above 50%! With bullish numbers like these, it makes the failure rate seem tolerable.
