Until I'm ready to build a similar cheet sheet for other aspects of trading I'll leave this here:

## Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns - Cheat Sheet

Taking notes while reading Encyclopedia of Chart patterns [by Thomas Bulkowski](https://www.amazon.com/Encyclopedia-Chart-Patterns-Thomas-Bulkowski/dp/0471668265). Ultimately, I'll study other sources on the same subject and replace Bulkowski's words with my own. I'm just becomming familiar with the subject, atm.

### Intro

According to BabyPips there are [3 main groups](https://www.babypips.com/learn/forex/how-to-trade-chart-patterns) of trading patterns:

1. Reversal
   * Double Top
   * Double Bottom
   * Head and Shoulders
   * Inverse Head and Shoulders
   * Rising Wedge
   * Falling Wedge
2. Continuation
   * wedges
   * rectangles
   * pennants
* Note that wedges can be considered either reversal or continuation patterns depending on the trend on which they form.
3. Bi-lateral
   * Triangles

## Broadening Formations 

Broadening formations are generally considered bearish, and involve increased volitility with no clear direction.

Good for those who work on a low timeframe.

>A broadening formation is an example of a consolidation pattern and a highly useful tool in the prediction of the likelihood of a reversal in the direction of a current trend. When found in an uptrend it indicates not a continuation of that trend, but a near-term reversal of the price action.

Bulkowski seems to be the only person who has tested different broadening patterns, mostly they are considered as a class and not worth spending too much time on the variants unless noted otherwise.

>Broadening tops, not surprisingly, act a lot like broadening bottoms. What separates a top from a bottom is the price trend leading to the chart pattern.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/wJhx8U7.png"/>


>There should be at least two minor highs and two minor lows before die chart pattern becomes a broadening top. A minor high is another name for a distinct price peak. A minor low refers to the valley pattern as prices descend to a low then turn back up. Again, the minor low should be a distinct trough that is easily recognizable. Figure 4.1 shows diree minor highs touching die top trendline and four minor lows either nearing or touching die bottom trendline. The minor highs and minor lows need not alternate as prices crisscross die formation.


### Right-Angled and Ascending [**^**](#Contents)

* [Bulkowski - Broadening formations: Right-Angled and Ascending](http://thepatternsite.com/rabfa.html)

>The right-angled and ascending broadening chart pattern is not one you might choose to trade. -[source](https://education.howthemarketworks.com/advanced/charts-and-patterns/broadening-formations-right-angled-and-ascending/)

>Right-angled ascending broadening formations: What does the name mean? Right angle implies that it is a member of the triangle family. A horizontal base with an up-sloping hypotenuse forms a right triangle. The third side drops down from the hypotenuse to the base and intersects it at a 90 degree angle, forming the so-called right angle. Ascending means that the hypotenuse ascends over time as contrasted with descending broadening formations. Broadening formation means that prices make higher highs. Ascending and descending triangles, in contrast, have narrowing price movements.

## Right-Angled and Descending [**^**](#Contents)

* [Bulkowski - Broadening formations: Right-Angled and Descending](http://thepatternsite.com/rabfd.html)

The characteristic flat top and down-sloping bottom are apparent in the figure. These are the two key ingredients. Prices at the top of the formation reach the same price level before declining. Over time, a horizontal trendline can be drawn connecting them. 

Along the bottom of the formation, the minor lows touch a down-sloping trendline before prices rebound. Eventually, prices break out of the formation by either closing above the top trendline or below the bottom one.

* [TradingView - Ideas - Descending Broadening Wedge](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/descendingbroadeningwedge/)
* [Bulkowski - Descending Broadening Wedge](http://thepatternsite.com/dbw.html)
  > "Descending broadening wedges are mid list performers, found most often with upward breakouts in a bull market." 


<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/AUDUSD/BTTUvzhp-AUDUSD-Descending-Broadening-Wedge-And-Short-Setup/"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/jV5HN0x.png"/></a>

>descending broadening wedges act as a consolidation of the prevailing trend. The volume pattern is also different from falling wedges. In the descending broadening wedge formation, the volume tends to increase over time but with falling wedges, it decreases.

During my search through the various stocks in the database, I noticed that this formation appears most often after an uptrend. Prices move down in a broadening wedge for several months then return to their original direction: up.

Once I knew that the formation acts as a consolidation of the trend, then trend reversals become failures. Also, formations that are consolidations but fail to move more than 5% in the breakout direction (after a breakout) are also failures. Altogether, 37% of the formations fail. That is well above the maximum 20% that I consider reliable formations to possess.

Being a consolidation in a bull market, the average rise is a very high 46%. The most likely rise is 20% and an astounding 40% of the formations have gains above 50%! With bullish numbers like these, it makes the failure rate seem tolerable.

## Bump-and-Run Reversal Bottoms [**^**](#Contents)

* https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/bump/
* [Bulkowski - Bump and Run Reversal Bottoms](http://thepatternsite.com/barrb.html)
  >The bump-and-run reversal bottom is a chart pattern that is a surprisingly good performer in both bull and bear markets. It has a low break even failure rate and high average rise after the breakout. Discovered by Thomas Bulkowski in 1999.

If you wait for a breakout, the failure rate drops from 19% to 9%. I consider anything less than 20% to indicate a reliable formation. The average gain is 37%. This is a bit shy of the usual 40% for bullish formations, but the most likely rise, at 20%, is quite good.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/t6Ft0C9.png"/>

Many would recognize this formation as a cup-with-handle, and indeed it is. But it is also a BARR bottom, as a cup does not depend on a down-sloping trendline and a larger handle on the left such as that shown in Figure 7.1. Whatever you call the formation, the result is still the same: Prices move
higher.

<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/ITC/d5Pr576Q-ITC-Bulkowski-s-Bump-and-Run-Reversal-Bottoms-LONG/"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/hJAhGQL.png"></a>


## Bump-and-Run Reversal Tops [**^**](#Contents)

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/2JpGC1p.png"/>

* https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/bump/
* [Bulkowski - Bump and Run Reversal Top](http://thepatternsite.com/barrt.html)

The overall formation reminds me of a mountain range. The foothills at the start of the formation are low and subdued, not venturing too far above the up-sloping plain. Volume at the start of the formation is high but quickly recedes. The mountains themselves rise up well above the foothills on high volume. 

Investor enthusiasm continues high as prices round over at the top, then diminishes on the far side. When the mountains end, prices decline sharply and continue moving down. That is a BARR. Prices bump-up, round over, and run back down again. The formation is the visual representation of momentum. The base of the formation follows a trendline that always slopes upward. It signals investors' eagerness to acquire the stock. As each day goes by, investors bid higher to reluctant sellers and the price rises

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/jEwAZ1E.png"/>


Other momentum players eventually notice the rise in the stock price. Many jump on the bandwagon the day after a surprisingly good earnings announcement. That is when the bump begins. Volume spikes upward along with the stock price. Quickly rising prices entice others to join the fray and that, in turn, sends the stock even higher. As momentum increases, prices jump up to form a new, higher-sloping trendline. Then things start going wrong.


## Cup with Handle [**^**](#Contents)

* [Bulkowski - Cup with Handle](http://thepatternsite.com/cup.html)
* [Babypips - Cup and Handle](https://www.babypips.com/forexpedia/cup-with-handle)

As I was selecting cup-with-handle formations, it became apparent that locating cups during an uptrend is important. So, I adopted O'Neil's criteria of a minimum 30% rise leading up to the cup.

All the cups are U-shaped (V-shaped ones being removed). Also removed from the study were cups without handles. To me, a cup without a handle is a rounding bottom

## Dead-Cat Bounce [**^**](#Contents)

It is not so much a chart formation as it is a warning to exit the stock quickly after a dramatic decline. The event decline, which is the decline that spawns the dead-cat bounce, averages 25%. After the event decline, prices bounce up, round over, and continue down another 15%, on average (measured from the event low to the ultimate low). 

The larger the event decline, the larger the bounce.

* [Diamond Top Formation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/diamondtop.asp)
* [Babypips - Diamond](https://www.babypips.com/forexpedia/diamond)

In appearance, the only difference between the two diamond patterns is the price trend leading to the formation. For diamond tops, the prior price trend is upward, whereas diamond bottoms have price trends that lead down to the formation.


<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/ETHBTC/INJrp9Cq-ETH-BTC-Diamond-Chart-Formation/"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ypAwM5z.png"/></a>
>The Diamond pattern is a rare, but reliable chart pattern. Diamond chart reversals rarely happen at market bottoms, it most often occurs at major tops and with high-volume. Bulkowski's (2005) research states that the diamond bottom breaks upward 69% of the time. Bulkowski emphasizes that a diamond bottom with a breakout move downward is ranked as being one the best performing patterns. You should always use a stop loss order when trading the diamond pattern. The proper location of your stop should be above the last top inside the diamond for bearish setups and below the last low of inside the diamond for bullish setups. - ([source](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/ETHBTC/INJrp9Cq-ETH-BTC-Diamond-Chart-Formation/))

## Double Bottoms [**^**](#Contents)

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/dFtYbCI.png"/>

* [Bulkowski's Double Bottom Types](http://thepatternsite.com/DoubleBottomTypes.html)
* [Bulkowski's Double Bottom Setup](http://thepatternsite.com/dbsetup.html)


Perhaps the biggest surprise with double bottoms is the high failure rate at 64%. Only a third of the formations classify as true double bottoms. They are the ones that have prices rising above the confirmation point, which is the highest high between the two lows. The failure rate tumbles to just 3 % if one waits for confirmation. Only those formations with confirmed breakouts are evaluated in this study.

<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/NZDCAD/NgLOZjGz-NZDCAD-Possible-Double-Bottom-and-a-H-S-Failure/"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/azIqHVp.png"/></a>

A double bottom is not a true double bottom until prices rise above the confirmation point. In tabulating the statistics, / only count those double bottoms in which prices rise above the confirmation point. Why? Because of the high failure rate: 64%. There were 980 formations that looked like double bottoms, but their price trends eventually moved below the second bottom. 

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/53OpzHM.png"/>

An additional 525 formations performed as expected by rising to the confirmation point and continuing higher. If you buy a stock just after it touches the second bottom, your chances of having a successful trade are one in three. In other words, wait for prices to rise above the confirmation point.

## Double Tops [**^**](#Contents)

If wait for the breakout, then you will be correct in dumping your shares 83% of the time. However, almost half the formations decline less than 15%, and nearly two out of three formations fall shy of their predicted price targets.


>The double top is one of the most popular patterns in trading. It's a reliable reversal pattern that can be used to enter a bearish position after a bullish trend. It consists of 2 tops at nearly the same level with a valley in between, which creates the neckline. The second top does not break the level of the first top, so the price retested this level and tried to make a higher high, but failed. Price breaking the neckline and closing below it would complete the pattern. 

>Conservative traders look for additional confirmation and aggressive traders may enter a bearish position from the second top. The target can be estimated by measuring the height of the pattern and projecting this downwards from the neckline. Common stop levels are just above the neckline, halfway between the neckline and the tops or above the tops.

<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/EURUSD/XEPEQbbm-3-TRADING-STRATEGY-S-IN-ONE-CHART-EXPLAINED/"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/45lsZvz.png"/></a>

For double tops, only 39% of the formations decline far enough to fulfill the prediction. Reliable values are above 80%. The poor showing of this formation further emphasizes that many double top patterns do not decline far and this formation may not be worth trading at all.

The question then becomes, is it worth taking profits on a confirmed double top? If prices continue down an additional 15 % and then turn around, why not just wait for prices to recover? Those are good questions. If you sell when the double top is confirmed, you may be selling near the ultimate low.

## Flags and Pennants [**^**](#Contents)

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/q0PnCFP.png"/>

Flags and pennants look alike and in many ways their performance is similar, too. The formations are usually very short in duration, from a few days to 3 weeks, and mark the halfway point in a quick price move. 


<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/EURINR/WZdNVSyC-Educational-07-Flag-and-Pennant-Patterns/"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/muwtsBo.png"></a>

These formations can be profitable short-term investments, but you must be nimble and attentive to take full advantage of them. 

Pennants, with a failure rate of 34% in downtrends, are above the 20% rate I consider acceptable. Flags at 12% to 13 % and pennants in a uptrend (19%) perform better.

* [Bulkowski - Flags](http://thepatternsite.com/flags.html)

The percentage of formations that meet or exceed their predicted price targets is disappointing for both flags and pennants. I view values above 80% to be reliable, but the results show values that range from 52% to 63%, suggesting that you should trade these formations with caution as your profits may not be as large as you expect.

* [High and Tight Flag Pattern](https://www.tothetick.com/archives/1835)

Having recently completed the chapter on flags and pennants, I was surprised to discover an abundance of high, right flags. 

>if you wait for an upside breakout, the rate drops to 17%. Reliable formations have failure rates below 20%, so high, tight flags score well providing you wait for the breakout.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/X36eWBB.png"/>

First and most importantly there must be a short, quick rise. Flags with a receding volume trend handily outperform those without. However, I would not ignore a high, tight flag simply because volume is rising. Rather, I would recognize that its  performance may be subpar.


## Gaps [**^**](#Contents)

* [Investopedia - University - Gaps](https://www.investopedia.com/university/charts/charts8.asp)
* [Bulkowski - Gauging Gaps](http://thepatternsite.com/GaugingGaps.html)

A gap appears in an uptrend price series when yesterday's daily high is below today's low price. A downtrend gap is similar, being created when yesterday's low is above today's high. In both cases, some type of exuberance is driving the
stock to create a gap. 

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/zW5p40p.png"/>

It sometimes is nothing more than the stock being worth less simply because of a dividend distribution. At other times, the repercussions are more severe. An earnings surprise, either positive or negative, often causes a gap and the stock to rise by 10% or 15% or to decline by 30% or more, depending on the severity of the news

Hanging man formations with upside breakouts show gains averaging 40%, which is quite good, but the most likely gain is 10%—comparatively poor. For downside breakouts, the average loss is 16% with a likely loss between 5% and 10%. If you decide to trade this formation, do not expect a large price move.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/l29D51i.png">

After careful consideration, I cannot recommend trading this formation. The primary belief behind this chart pattern is that prices will reverse the uptrend. They do not. Just a third of the formations reverse, whereas the others see prices continue higher.

>With 93% of the formations breaking out downward and continuing to move down, there is no need to wait for a breakout before trading.

>When a formation appears with more than the standard two shoulders and one head it is called a complex head-and-shoulders pattern. Complex head-and-shoulders patterns for both tops and bottoms have their own chapters but many appear in this chapter's statistics. They are, after all, head-and-shoulder tops too.

>Except for appearance, there is not much difference between a normal headand-shoulders top and a complex one. Add a dual head or a few extra shoulders to a regular formation and you have a complex head-and-shoulders top. The left shoulders often have higher volume than the corresponding right ones.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/Rh2tyXx.png"/>

>If you ignore the labels for a moment, the inner price action looks like a rounding top. This smooth price rollover is common for complex head-andshoulder formations. Of course, the flat head shape for a multiple shoulder pattern (Figure 21.2) is also typical.

The theory behind the formation says an investor can expect a large price move the day after an inside day;

<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/USDJPY/sKSELCBl-USDJPY-inside-bar-trade/"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/1BitDsp.png"></a>

>"when the close is within 25% of the prior day's low, a downside breakout occurs 70% of the time. Thus, if you have an inside day that closes near the prior days low, expect a downside breakout"

Outside days are mirror images of inside days. Outside days are characterized by a wider price range, one that is both higher and lower than the prior day.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/WAw8N31.png"/>

The formation comes in two varieties: those with upside breakouts and those with downside ones. 

* Upside breakouts, as the Results Snapshot outlines, sport a failure rate of 25%, just above the maximum 20% rate that I consider acceptable. The average rise is a subpar 32% with a likely rise of less than 10%. 

* Downside breakouts perform substantially worse in some respects. Their failure rate is exceedingly high at 42% with an average decline of 17%. The average decline is not bad for a bearish formation but the most likely loss is less than 10%.

With likely gains or losses of less than 10%, you have to consider whether this formation is worth trading. Meager gains coupled with a high failure rate suggest dial this is probably one formation to avoid.



## Measured Move Down [**^**](#Contents)

  >The measured move down is a unique chart pattern best used as a tool to help predict where price is going. The second leg of the measured move approaches the length and duration of the first leg. Once the measured move down completes, price often retraces to the corrective phase, too. That is invaluable information for swing traders.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/y2jzXbN.png"/>

>Unfortunately, with a failure rate of 22%, it is also more risky.  That is not to say that this one is unreliable, especially since it has a 36% average decline, which is well above the usual 20% decline for bearish reversals. For this formation even the most likely decline is high but wide at 25% to 40%.

## Pipe Bottoms [**^**](#Contents)

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/dyRppHO.png"/>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/qVKyuYo.png"/>

After researching the performance of horn tops and bottoms, the natural thing to do is to remove the intervening week and test the pattern again. That is where the pipe formation comes from. Pipes bottoms are an exciting discovery with a low failure rate (12%) and a high average rise (47%).

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/KicO0vz.png"/>

Perhaps the most critical feature of a pipe bottom is what happens in the third week. While you can easily spot two adjacent downward price spikes, toss the formation aside if prices do not rise the third week. The third week, the week following the second pipe spike, should leave a well-defined dual spike visible on the price chart. The 4-week pair (which includes the weeks before and after the pipe) is V-shaped and is even more clear when combined with a downward price trend.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/jadbsvZ.png"/>

As mentioned in Table 30.4, a downward price trend is usually where you will see these formations, at least the best performing ones. Prices move down, reach the pipe bottom, then turn around and start climbing. Figures 30.1 and 30.2 are good examples of this behavior.

## Pipe Tops [**^**](#Contents)

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/WFvJT9l.png"/>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/prwyCmo.png"/>
Two adjacent upward price spikes on the weekly chart

If you compare the above statistics with horn tops, you will not find much difference because the two formations are similar, even in appearance. 

Still, the 18% failure rate for pipe tops is quite good, below the 20% maximum for formations that I consider reliable. The average decline is 21 % with a likely loss between 10% and 20%. 

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/cIEKoFG.png"/>

This is an improvement from horn tops, which show the most likely loss to be just 10%. The best performing pipe tops are those with price trends at least 3 months long leading down to the formation. 

The pipes appear as part of a retrace in a downtrend and perform much better than other combinations. They score average losses of 24% with a smaller failure
rate of 11%.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/15fzfkY.png"/>

## Rectangle Bottoms [**^**](#Contents)

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/4iCP88e.png"/>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/04cSZH3.png"/>
Prices trend down to the formation then oscillate between two horizontal trendlines before breaking out upward.

The failure rate for rectangles with upside breakouts is 0%. Do not get too excited as the sample size is small (41 formations). I do not believe that upside breakouts never fail. They do, it just did not shappen on my shift. One thing is clear, though: They are reliable. The average rise is 46%, above the usual 40% gain for bullish formations. 

The most likely rise at 20% is about what you would expect. With such a large gain, it is no surprise that the formation meets its price target 93% of the time. I consider anything above 80% to be reliable.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/HV0JNvB.png"/>

Rectangles with downside breakouts perform almost as well. They have a 4% failure rate. That is very good as I consider reliable anything below 20%.

The average loss is 19%, just shy of the usual 20% for bearish formations. Pullbacks score well, appearing 70% of the time. 

That score is high enough on which to base a trading tactic. After a downside breakout, short the stock then add to the position once a pullback returns to the formation and begins moving down again (always wait for the downside move because prices might continue climbing)

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/toGtSIm.png"/>

Of the 95 bottoms studied, I found slightly more rectangles acting as consolidations (54) of the prevailing price trend than reversals (41). Expect the breakout direction to follow the trend leading to the formation. 

If, upon entry, prices are moving down, expect them to continue moving lower after the breakout 55% of the time. That result is not much above a coin toss but it is
useful.

As mentioned in the Focus on Failures section, just two formations fail, placing the failure rate at 4% for rectangles with downside breakouts or 2 % for rectangle bottoms overall. Let me emphasize that because I did not find any failures of rectangle patterns with upside breakouts does not mean there are none. I just did not find any in the stocks I was looking at. However, as a rule, rectangle bottom formations rarely fail, but they do have premature breakouts, so be careful

## Rectangle Tops [**^**](#Contents)

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/CYtc3dW.png"/>\
Prices trend up to the formation then oscillate between two horizontal trendlines before breaking out upward.
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/f1NkDko.png">

Rectangle tops with upside breakouts fail 2% of the time. The average rise is an astounding 52% with a likely gain between 20% and 30%. These numbers are excellent. With such a large gain, it is no surprise that the measure rule works out well with 91% of the formations hitting their price targets.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/jLKxWpD.png"/>

Downside breakouts tell a similar tale, but one that is not quite as rosy. Downside breakouts have a 0% failure rate not because they are excellent performers, but because I did not find any that failed. I am sure there are rectangle tops with downside breakouts that fail to move down by less than 5%. The average loss is 20% with a strong likely decline of 20%, too. 

This is unusual but it suggests there are few large declines to skew the average. A glance at the frequency distribution shows that the assumption is correct. The percentage of formations with downside breakouts meeting or exceeding the price target is 77%, just below the 80% threshold that I consider reliable.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/yQ7LFRg.png"/>

## Rounding Bottoms [**^**](#Contents)

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/QUD9peo.png"/>
A long, rounded upward turn in prices
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/0DN8Eyy.png"/>

Rounding bottoms, rounding turns, and saucers are synonyms for the same formation. The pattern differs from the cup-with-handle and scallop formations in subtle ways, so be sure to study those formations if you are unsure about identification.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/Ix0NfwP.png"/>

If you consider that this formation acts as a consolidation of the prevailing trend and anything acting contrary to that is a failure, then the failure rate for this pattern is very high at 38%. However, if you consider upside breakouts only (a breakout being when prices move above the left saucer lip), then the failure rate drops to just 5%. I consider failure rates above 20% to be alarming.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/1fsPJby.png">

The chart pattern sports a 54% average gain with a likely rise of 20%. Almost a quarter of the formations have gains over 90% and that pulls the average upward. The large gain masks the performance of the most likely rise. With a deep cup formed over many months, it makes sense that the measure rule would have trouble predicting accurate price targets. Prices fulfill the measure rule just 36% of the time for successful formations with upside breakouts.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/RgZzSqE.png"/>

## Rounding Tops [**^**](#Contents)

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/8h5IOLL.png"/>\
As prices move up, they curve around then breakout upward.
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/g5UCVDY.png"/>

When is a top not a top? When it is a rounding top or dome and prices break out upward. That is the real surprise with this formation as most of the rounding tops have upside breakouts. The failure rate is 19%, a sliver below the maximum rate of 20% that I consider reliable formations to possess. If you wait for an upside breakout, then the failure rate drops to 6%. 

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/Eonv5PY.png"/>

At first, I set the breakout point as being one-third up the formation. I considered that a 30% retrace after the dome rounds over as a sign of an upside breakout. Prices pierce many
down-sloping trendlines by that rise and it also gives other investors time to recognize the trend change (so they help push up the price). However, the results were just too unreal to use (a 0% failure rate and average climb of 58%).

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/L4j4crv.png"/>

The computation neglected other formations that began moving up but ultimately ended lower. I reworked the figures using the dome top as the breakout point. The results are more in line with other formations. Rounding tops have an average gain of 41 %, with a likely rise between 20% and 40%.

## Scallops-Ascending and Descending [**^**](#Contents)

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/JIv7ite.png"/>

Prices peak, retrace, and curve around then form a higher peak. The price pattern looks like the letter J.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/4yKck1v.png"/>

The classic definition of scallops refers to the ascending variety only, where you find repeated saucer-shaped formations in a rising price trend. I reasoned that if there is an ascending variety, there probably is a descending variety. I decided to find out, but before I discuss the two types of formations in detail, I think it is worth reviewing the major findings.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/73BHv5f.png"/>

For ascending scallops, the failure rate at 25% is above the 20% maximum that reliable formations possess. Descending scallops have a failure rate of just 3%. Why the big difference in failure rates? The difference is because I use the highest high on the right side of the formation to calculate the percentage change to the ultimate high or low. For ascending scallops, this penalizes performance since the right edge is much higher than the left. For descending scallops, it helps performance because the right side is well above the formation low and the ultimate low.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/XDvT2c0.png"/>

The percentage rise for ascending scallops is 33%, respectable but mediocre when compared to other bullish formations. For descending scallops, the declines average 24%; that is quite good (we usually see a 20% decline for bearish patterns). The measure rule is weak in both species and especially so with the descending variety—only 52% of the chart patterns reach their price targets.

One surprising finding is that consecutively ascending scallops get narrower and shorter, on average, when compared with prior scallops in a series. For example, in a line of four ascending scallops, the first one will be wider andvtaller than the last one. The relationship for descending scallops is unknown because of a dearth of consecutive formations.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/luEF0Tu.png"/>

Despite this formation being only 3 days long, I applied the 5% failure rule to its performance. A 5% failure occurs when prices move less than 5% in the breakout direction before reversing and moving significantly in the new direction. For sharks with upside breakouts, the failure rate is exceedingly high at 41 %. The failure rate is even worse for downside breakouts at 44%. I consider formations to be
reliable if the failure rate is below 20%. 

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/zG70s3k.png"/>

If your worst enemy tells you this is the formation to trade, ignore him; he is trying to lead you into bankruptcy. With a failure rate nearly the same as a fair coin toss, why risk a trade? 

## Triangles [**^**](#Contents)

### Ascending [**^**](#Contents)

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/NXLuicp.png"/>\
Triangle shape with horizontal top, up-sloping bottom
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/XrpsvKL.png"/>

Have you ever heard someone say, "I just happened to be in the right place at the right time?" Perhaps you have even said it yourself. Investing is a lot like that—being in the right stock just before it takes off. That is one of the reasons the ascending triangle is one of my favorite formations. You can make a bundle of money if you trade it properly. But before we get to trading tactics, let us look more closely at ascending triangles.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/z0U8smw.png"/>

The ascending triangle has a poor failure rate of 32%. However, if you wait for an upside breakout, then the failure rate drops to just 2 %.

For upside breakouts, the average rise is a strong 44%. A frequency distribution of the gains suggests that the most likely gain is 20%. With such avstrong showing, prices fulfill the measure rule 89% of the time. I consider values above 80% to be reliable, so this chart pattern stacks up well.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/zdP81ph.png"/>

### Descending [**^**](#Contents)

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/JgtnCed.png"/>\
Triangle shape with horizontal bottom and downsloping top

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/q3NENt9.png"/>

The Results Snapshot shows performance results for descending triangles. The failure rate at 45% is well above the 20% cutoff for reliable formations. However, if you wait for a downside breakout, then the failure rate drops to just 4%.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/MgOqrpW.png"/>

The average decline, at 19%, is about what you would expect from a bearish formation. The most likely decline, at 10% to 20%, is evenly distributed across the range. Premature breakouts occur in nearly a quarter of the formations (22%), so that is something to watch out for.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/xBhIsN1.png"/>

### Symmetrical Bottoms [**^**](#Contents)

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/6gq7YsK.png"/>\
Prices trend down then form lower highs and higher lows following two sloping trendlines that eventually intersect. The breakout is downward

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/f5DErut.png"/>

I separated symmetrical triangles into two types: those with prices trending up to the formation and those with prices trending down. The way you invest in each type may vary, so I wanted to collect the most beneficial statistics for investors. This chapter deals with symmetrical triangle bottoms, where prices trend down to the formation.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/47drekg.png"/>

The failure rates at 2% and 3% are surprisingly small. Once a breakout occurs, prices tend to keep going and do not suffer from a 5% failure (that is, a quick reversal). The average move after a breakout is about what you would expect for bullish and bearish formations. Downside breakouts show losses averaging 19%, whereas upside ones gain 41%

### Symmetrical Tops [**^**](#Contents)

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/VZaoiVZ.png"/>

In a rising price trend, prices form lower highs and higher lows following two sloping trendlines that eventually intersect. The breakout is downward.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/QsUGAxa.png"/>

Those of you familiar with symmetrical triangles might wonder how I separated them into tops and bottoms. I use the price trend leading to the formation. Symmetrical triangle tops have prices that trend up to the formation, whereas bottoms have prices leading down. I separated them by price trend in
the hope that it would allow prediction of the breakout direction. Alas, it did not. 

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/CDIOiqj.png"/>

This chapter concerns itself with symmetrical triangle tops. The failure rates for symmetrical triangle tops are low at 6% and 5% for the two breakout directions. This compares favorably with the maximum 20% rate I consider reliable formations to possess.

Downside breakouts shows losses of 20%, about average for bearish formations. 

Upside breakouts, however, underperform with gains of 37% instead of the usual 40% for bullish chart patterns. But they are solid performers according to the measure rule (81% hit their targets). I consider values above 80% to be reliable. Downside breakouts fall short with only 62% meeting or exceeding their price targets.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/6hNVjNm.png"/>

## Triple Bottoms [**^**](#Contents)

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/LBCbJ5H.png"/>\
Three distinct minor lows at about the same price level
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/YtiLSKx.png"/>

One of the surprising things about triple bottoms is their low failure rate: 4%. For some reason, I expected it to be higher. If one plays by the rules and waits for an upside breakout, then few triple bottoms fail to continue moving up, many times substantially. The average rise is 38% with a likely gain of 20%, about what you would expect from bullish formations.


<img src="http://i.imgur.com/6krd5ZW.png"/>

Almost three out of four formations (70%) throw back to the breakout point. This is somewhat misleading because the breakout point can be far removed from the final trough—an average of almost 6 weeks away. But the time is well spent as prices climb from the third recession to the breakout or confirmation point.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/wzdEft3.png"/>

Just for kicks, I measured the average gain for those formations with a third bottom above the low posted by the second one. The gain is 48%, whereas those with a third bottom below the second one score gains averaging just 31%.

The differences are statistically significant but it may surprise you to learn the average price difference between the two bottoms is only 35 cents.

## Triple Tops [**^**](#Contents)

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/MsDzt4h.png"/>\
Three distinct minor highs at about the same price
level
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/aNVLzWF.png"/>

The failure rate at 15% for triple tops approaches the 20% maximum*! consider permissible for reliable formations. Still, there are a number of formations that perform worse, so there is no reason for concern. 

To take a more optimistic view, there is an 85% chance that prices will decline by more than 5%. The average loss is 21% with a likely decline of only 10%. So, if you are depending on the triple top formation to score an outsized decline, the probabilities are against you.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/JdC0c8Y.png"/>

The pullback rate at 84% is one of the highest I have seen. This means you will have another opportunity to either sell your holdings before the real decline begins or add to your short position. It suggests some hesitancy for prices to break away.

Before you place a trade in a security showing a triple top, think about a short decline. Only 47% of the formations meet their price targets, whereas reliable readings are above 80%. It is comparatively unlikely that prices will decline by more than the formation height.

One surprising finding about triple tops is when the price of the highest high in the third top is above the second top. Formations with this configuration have losses of 22% versus 17%. The differences are statistically significant
meaning that die results likely are not due to chance.

There are no outstanding surprises among the statistics shown in the Results Snapshot. The failure rate for falling wedges is low at 10%. This low failure rate, coupled with an average rise of 43% and a likely rise of between 20% and 30%, suggests it is a profitable formation to trade. However, it is also quite rare.

The percentage of falling wedges meeting the predicted price target, at 88%, is very high but then the benchmark is easy. Prices need only rise above the top of the formation to hit the target. My statistics show the most powerful breakouts occur at 50% to 80% of the distance to the apex (the center of this range being two-thirds of the way to the apex). By powerful, I mean that stocks falling within the range show
larger gains, on average.

As formations go, the rising wedge is one of the poorer performing chart patterns. It sports a failure rate of 24%, which falls to 6% if you wait for a downside breakout. The average decline is 19%, just a bit below the usual
20% decline for other bearish chart patterns.

One interesting finding concerns the volume trend. Successful formations with a receding volume trend outperform those with a rising volume trend; the losses are 21% and 15%, respectively. This means if you restrict your selections to those showing receding volume throughout the formation, you should do better. On the flip side, you will also be passing up many formations in which you could trade profitably.

Only 38% of the formations have high volume downside breakouts.
Apparently, prices can fall of their own weight even on low volume.

## Weekly Reversals-Downside [**^**](#Contents)

Perhaps the most remarkable feature of the downside weekly reversal formation, if you can call it a formation, is its high failure rate at 37%. One out of three downside weekly reversals fail! I consider failure rates below 20% to be acceptable, so this chart pattern should serve as a warning: 

Perhaps you should skip this one.

The average decline is 18% with a likely loss of 10%. The average decline is a little less than what you would expect (20%) from a well-performing bearish reversal. 

The reversal does have some interesting statistical findings. First, weekly reversals usually occur near a price peak and quite often near a major peak (signaling a change in the primary trend). The further from the peak the reversal occurs, the more likely it is to end in failure. This makes intuitive sense because prices are already sliding down the trend before the reversal hits and takes them closer to the ultimate low.

## Weekly Reversals-Upside [**^**](#Contents)

The Results Snapshot shows a quick synopsis of the statistical results for upside weekly reversals. The formation performs substantially better than its brother, the downside weekly reversal.

The upside variety sports a failure rate of 23%, still above the 20% maximum that I consider reliable formations should meet. Its average rise at 44% is quite high until you consider the most likely gain is 20%. The difference between the two values suggests there are a significant number of large gains pulling the average upward. A frequency distribution of the gains, which is where the most likely gain comes from, suggests meager gains are the norm.

How can you gain 44% in 3 months? Normally, you cannot. A frequency distribution of the days to the ultimate high shows that most formations (47%) reach the high in 3 months or less. The next highest category, at 38%, is for those formations with long-term gains (taking over 6 months to reach the ultimate high). The large number of quick but small gains are why the most likely gain is so low. It is not a contradiction at all, just a warning that this formation either performs poorly or very well. There is little middle ground.

The percentage of upside weekly reversals meeting their price targets at 84% is above the 80% reliability threshold. The high value should not come as a complete surprise since most bullish formations score well. The results are helped, in part, by each stock participating in a bull market over the 5 years under study.

I compared the gains for successful upside weekly reversals when their volume is half the 25-week moving average to reversals having volume 50% above the average. The performance associated with the low volume variety show gains of 38%; the higher volume reversals have gains of 44%. The difference between the two results is statistically significant. However, when raising the volume benchmark to two, three, and four times the moving average, performance steadily declines. Another study of all formations, both successful and unsuccessful ones, supports the deteriorating performance results as volume increases.

Performance improves with a wider weekly price range. The results range from an average gain of 15% for those formations with a narrow price range to 57% for those with a wider range.
